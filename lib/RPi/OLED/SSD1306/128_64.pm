=head1 NAME

RPi::OLED::SSD1306::128_64 - Interface to the SSD1306-esque 128x64 OLED displays

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides the ability to use the 128x64 SSD1306 type OLED displays.

This distribution requires wiringPi version 2.36+ to be installed.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new([$i2c_addr])

Instantiates and returns a new L<< RPi::OLED::SSD1306::128x64 >> object.

Note that this module is a singleton; if you've already instantiated a new
OLED device object, it will be returned if C<new()> is called again.

Parameters:

    $i2c_addr

Optional, Integer. The I2C address of your OLED screen. Defaults to C<0x3C>,
which is extremely common.

=head2 clear

Wipes the display clean, and sets the cursor to the top-left position on the
screen.

Returns C<< 1 >> on success.

=head2 text_size($size)

By default, we use the smallest text size (C<1>) when displaying characters to
the OLED. You can increase or decrease the text size with this call.

Parameters:

    $size

Mandatory, Integer: A number to increase or decrease the font size to. Any
number is valid, but be realistic... this screen is only 128x64 pixels.

Returns C<< 1 >> on success.

=head2 display

Draws whatever you've put into the buffer to the screen. All calls that add
to the buffer (eg: C<rect()>, C<string()>, C<pixel()>, C<char()> etc) require
a call to this method after you've filled the buffer.

=head2 string($str, [$display])

Send a string to the display for printing.

Parameters:

    $str

Mandatory, String: The string you want put into the buffer for display.

    $display

Optional, Bool: All calls for displaying something to the screen require an
additional call to C<< display() >>. Send in a positive value (C<1>) as the
second parameter to this call and we'll call display automatically for you.

Returns C<< 1 >> on success.

=head2 rect($x, $y, $w, $h, $colour)

Prepares a rectangle for display on the screen. To actually display the
rectangle, a subsequent call to C<display()> is required.

Parameters:

    $x

Mandatory, Integer: The X-axis (horizontal) position from the left of the screen
to begin drawing the rectangle.

    $y

Mandatory, Integer: The Y-axis (vertical) position from the top of the screen to
begin drawing the rectangle.

    $w

Mandatory, Integer: How many pixels wide to draw the rect.

    $h

Mandatory, Integer: How many pixels tall (from the top) to draw the rect.

    $colour

Optional, Bool: By default, we use C<1> which is standard colour (white). Send
in C<0> and we'll use black, which will effectively wipe out whatever was on
the display in the area of the rectangle.

Returns C<< 1 >> on success.

=head2 char($x, $y, $char, $size, $colour)

Creates a buffer with a single ASCII char. As with other buffer calls, a call
to C<display()> is required once you're ready to display the buffer.

Parameters:

    $x

Mandatory, Integer: The X-axis (horizontal) position from the left of the screen
to begin drawing the char.

    $y

Mandatory, Integer: The Y-axis (vertical) position from the top of the screen to
begin drawing the char.

    $char

Mandatory, Integer: The integer representation of the ASCII char to draw. Valid
values are C<0-255>.

    $size

Optional, Integer: The size of the char on the screen. Defaults to C<2>.

    $colour

Optional, Bool: By default, we use C<1> which is standard colour (white). Send
in C<0> and we'll use black, which will effectively wipe out whatever was on
the display in the area of the char.

Returns C<< 1 >> on success.

=head2 pixel($x, $y, $colour)

Draw a single pixel to the screen.

Parameters:

    $x

Mandatory, Integer: The X-axis (horizontal) position from the left of the screen
to place the pixel.

    $y

Mandatory, Integer: The Y-axis (vertical) position from the top of the screen to
place the pixel.

    $colour

Optional, Bool: By default, we use C<1> which is standard colour (white). Send
in C<0> and we'll use black, which will effectively wipe out whatever was on
the display in the area of the pixel.

Returns C<< 1 >> on success.

=head2 horizontal_line($x, $y, $w, $colour)

Draw a single pixel wide horizontal line.

Parameters:

    $x

Mandatory, Integer: The X-axis (horizontal) position from the left of the screen
to begin drawing the horizontal line.

    $y

Mandatory, Integer: The Y-axis (vertical) position from the top of the screen to
begin drawing the horizontal line.

    $w

Mandatory, Integer: How many pixels wide to draw the horizontal line.

    $colour

Optional, Bool: By default, we use C<1> which is standard colour (white). Send
in C<0> and we'll use black, which will effectively wipe out whatever was on
the display in the area of the rectangle.

Returns C<1> on success.

=head2 vertical_line($x, $y, $h, $colour)

Draw a single-pixel wide vertical line.

Parameters:

    $x

Mandatory, Integer: The X-axis (horizontal) position from the left of the screen
to begin drawing the vertical line.

    $y

Mandatory, Integer: The Y-axis (vertical) position from the top of the screen to
begin drawing the vertical line.

    $w

Mandatory, Integer: How many pixels tall to draw the vertical line.

    $colour

Optional, Bool: By default, we use C<1> which is standard colour (white). Send
in C<0> and we'll use black, which will effectively wipe out whatever was on
the display in the area of the rectangle.

Returns C<1> on success.

=head2 dim($bool)

The screen has two brightness levels, dim and full.

Parameters:

    $bool

Optional, Bool: Send in C<1> to dim the display, and C<0> to turn it to its
maximum brightness. Defaults to C<0> if not sent in.

Returns C<1> on success.

=head2 invert_display($bool)

By default, the screen background is black, and anything you draw will be
white. Inverting the screen will reverse those two colours.

Parameters:

    $bool

Optional, Bool: C<1> will invert the screen (black on white background), and
C<0> will set it back to normal (white on black background). Defaults to C<0> if
not sent in.

Returns C<1> on success.
